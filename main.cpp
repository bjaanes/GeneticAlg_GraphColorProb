/*
A GA has the following general steps:
3
ï¿¼1-Start with a population of chromosomes ( individuals) generated at random
2-Determine the fitness of the individuals by decoding their chromosomes and applying the fitness function
3-Select parent for next generation
4-Mate selected parents to produce offspring using genetic operators
    ( Different Methods )
5-Eliminate the individuals with weak fitness
    (Different Methods )
Repeat 3-5 until ( stop)
Solution = individual with the highest fitness
